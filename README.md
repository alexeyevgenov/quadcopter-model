This model is result of my research by post-graduation study.
The quadparam.m file loads the characteristics of the quadcopter into the working environment. Next, on the command line, you need to change the encoding:
bdclose all
slCharacterEncoding('Windows-1252')

Next, you can run the quadsim.mdl model itself and view the simulation results.
